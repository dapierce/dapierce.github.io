The modern web has mostly become 3-5 websites the past couple decades. They are powerful websites that most who use the internet frequent, and arguably the easiest way for someone to make a name for themselves.

But there will always be a place for your own unique presence that cannot be controlled by someone else. A place that you can really make your own. And in 2023, there are enough free tools online that you can entirely build yourself a new website, host it and maintain it completely through a web browser.

My website is largely built and maintained using a browser, and although I keep a copy of the repository on my own hard drive, ultimately most of my time spent on it has been remotely. I'm going to walk through how I do it.

## 11ty to GitHub

I started with a static site generator, [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and used their [starter blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), which allows you to get up and running with a simple blog website.

I made my own repository using the starter as a template, and from there I began tinkering with the code and layouts using GitHub's Codespaces. Basically, it opens VS Code on your browser and you can just start working on the site right there.
