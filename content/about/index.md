# About Me

Hello!

I'm **David Aaron Pierce**, an artist, occasional coder, and video games liker. I write things here, and maybe sometimes post my artwork and various experiments.

I don't have a huge presence online, and I mostly like to keep it that way. That said, I love to create, and it's nice to have the things I make [on a website that I control](/blog/2023-03-01-new-website) (looking at you, social media).

That being said, I do have accounts all over the place, covering an assortment of my interests.
